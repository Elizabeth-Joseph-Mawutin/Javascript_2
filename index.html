   <div class="txt">
        <p>The Free Web Africa designers award is for designers in Africa (web designers, graphic designers, UI/UX designers and video ad designers) that wants to highlight themselves to attract attention of the media, companies and customers (foreign and local) with their digital  skills.</p>
        <p>We believe that Africa as a whole is a reservoir of digitally skilled individuals, but if this skill is not appreciated it may not develop to its full potential. We believe that Africa posses the capacity to become global leaders in the technological and digital industry if her skills are harnessed to its full potential. That is the essence of the Free Web Africa designers award.  The award which is given annually will encourage designers to put more effort in developing themselves and their skill, not just to emerge as a winner in the award but to deliver high quality work to their clients as well as attract international recommendations.</p>
